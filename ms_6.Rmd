 Two weeks ago I made a preliminary plot containing all of the games from both men's and women's olympic results that I had scraped and the proportion of those games that had been won in the first game AND in the end. I found a rather high proportion of games, so this week I will focus on making a plot that qualifies this a bit more, with  information from the top 4 teams from olympic games ONLY, since these are the teams that make it to the semifinals and the finals. 
```{r gather from last time}
mens_olympic_url_print<- paste0("https://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/DisplayResults?tournamentId=560&associationId=0&teamNumber=0&drawNumber=0")
games2<-read_html(mens_olympic_url_print)
# this time I piped games2 into div and then table to get past the div barrier. 
games_tab2 <- games2 %>% 
  html_nodes("div") %>%
  html_nodes("table")

# Here, games_tab is a list of html nodes that contain "div" and then "table", singling out all of the results of the games.

single_game <- games_tab2[[1]] %>% html_table(header = T, fill = T) %>% clean_names()
names<- colnames(single_game)
# Here, single_game is turning a single game from my list of games into a tibble. I need to make this work for ALL the games in the doc

```
```{r looped call}
# going to maken empty tibble to later fill in a for loop
mens_test <- tibble()
# this defines x as having the correct setup but no data
x<- single_game %>%  slice(0)
# this for loop fills x every time with a new game from the games_tab list of
# html nodes

for(i in 1: length(games_tab2)) {
  # i is length of games_tab so that it iterates through each
 x <- games_tab2[[i]] %>% 
   # html_table is the function that turns the node into a table
    html_table(header = F, fill = T) %>%
   # this is kinda hacky. I turned header to F so that it fills the column names
   # into the first row, then using slice I isolate the second and third rows,
   # which are the actual data. this produces some amoung of waste since I'm not
   # ignoring the first row as much as I am simply slicing it out after wards,
   # but this is the best I could come up with.
  slice(2:3) 
 mens_test<- rbind(mens_test, x)
 # using rbind I add x to my ever-growing mens_test tibble. 
}
# setting up a vector of actual column names
names<- colnames(single_game)
names <- c(names, "id")
# adding id at the end

mens_test <- mens_test %>% 
  # this mutate call makes some assumptions: it assumes that the for loop worked
  # perfectly and put all the rows into mens_test in perfect order, then this
  # overlays an identifier on top, which goes "1 , 1 , 2, 2..." etc all the way
  # down.
  mutate(id = rep(1:length(games_tab2), each = 2)) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(names)

    # different number of games, and each game represents one row in html_list.

    test<- rbind(test, y)

    # of data --the next game, the next layer of lasagna.
